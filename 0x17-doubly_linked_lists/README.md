This directory provides solutions for tasks involving doubly linked lists in the C programming language.
A doubly linked list is a data structure that comprises a series of nodes. Each node contains two pointers, one indicating the previous node and the other indicating the next node. This design facilitates efficient traversal in both forward and backward directions.
