Dynamic libraries, often referred to as shared libraries, play a vital role in C software development. They offer reusability and modularity by enabling multiple programs to utilize the same library code. Dynamic libraries are loaded and linked during runtime, providing flexibility and the capability to update library functionality without the need to recompile the entire program.

This directory aims to provide practical examples, and useful commands pertaining to dynamic libraries in the C programming language.
